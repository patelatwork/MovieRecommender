# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommender System

A **Movie Recommender System** that suggests movies to users based on their mood. The system is built using **Streamlit** for a user-friendly interface and utilizes two CSV files:
1. `Movies.csv`: Contains movie details.
2. `PosterPaths.csv`: Contains URLs for movie posters.

The application dynamically recommends movies and displays posters to create an engaging user experience.
